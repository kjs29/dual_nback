# Dual N back game

### I got interested in making [N back game](https://github.com/kjs29/dual_nback) and I wanted to challenge myself so I decided to make dual N back game. My highest level is brown belt in the game so far, I dare you to achieve black belt!

# Dual N back game

The game is designed to enhance players' memory skills, and it shows series of numbers and positions one at a time. 

Players are supposed to memorize N-th number and position ago and compare those to current number and position. The higher the N, more challenging it becomes. 

# Download the game 

## Method 1 - Clone the repo from Github (MacOS or Windows)

Copy & Paste the following code below in your terminal.

The game will be downloaded in the folder named `~/Desktop/pygame_dual_nback`, wait a few seconds, and it will start playing automatically.
